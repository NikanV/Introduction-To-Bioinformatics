## Species Divergence

In conducting a comparative analysis of branch ages across three phylogenetic trees generated using Maximum Likelihood (ML), Neighbor-Joining (NJ), and Bayesian Inference (BN) methods, the top 10 species with the oldest divergence events were identified. Here are the results:

  - ### Maximum Likelihood (ML):
  1. Ovis aries: 4.669
  2. Rattus norvegicus: 4.667
  3. Taeniopygia guttata: 4.651
  4. Spheniscus demersus: 4.650
  5. Aptenodytes forsteri: 4.649
  6. Mus musculus: 4.640
  7. Pteropus vampyrus: 4.634
  8. Pelecanus crispus: 4.633
  9. Corvus brachyrhynchos: 4.632
  10. Pteropus alecto: 4.630

  - ### Neighbor-Joining (NJ):
  1. Pelecanus crispus: 1.164
  2. Spheniscus demersus: 1.137
  3. Aquila nipalensis: 1.135
  4. Aptenodytes forsteri: 1.134
  5. Eudynamys scolopaceus: 1.1179
  6. Anser cygnoides: 1.1175
  7. Cygnus cygnus: 1.1171
  8. Anas platyrhynchos: 1.113
  9. Struthio camelus: 1.102
  10. Dromaius novaehollandiae: 1.102

  - ### Bayesian Inference (BN):
  1. Pelecanus crispus: 3.612
  2. Aptenodytes forsteri: 3.590
  3. Spheniscus demersus: 3.587
  4. Aquila nipalensis: 3.556
  5. Eudynamys scolopaceus: 3.53
  6. Anas platyrhynchos: 3.484
  7. Cygnus cygnus: 3.483
  8. Anser cygnoides: 3.482
  9. Struthio camelus: 3.474
  10. Gallus gallus: 3.471

Across all three methods, *Pelecanus crispus* consistently emerges as having one of the most ancient divergence events, as evidenced by its high-ranking position in each list. This suggests that the Dalmatian pelican shares a deep evolutionary history, possibly diverging early from its common ancestor. Understanding such ancient divergences is pivotal in unraveling the evolutionary trajectory of species and can shed light on historical biogeographic patterns, environmental pressures, and adaptive strategies that have shaped their evolution over time.

## Common Ancestors


Upon further research on each of these species and searching their names, reading their habitats and characteristics, and viewing their images, I was quite fascinated about the groupings and the similarities species in a certain grouping had. Though I did find some groupings odd, and I will list them here:

Grouping of Ovis aries (sheep) with Pteropus vampyrus (bat), also these two having a common ancestor with Apis mellifera (insect) in Bayesian Inference Tree, was quite fascinating, which was different than what I previously thought.

Also, the grouping of Gobio gobio (fish) and Capreolus capreolus (deer) and them having a common ancestor was also different than what I previously thought.


## Methodology Insights

  - Maximum Likelihood (ML) methods, often produce trees that reflect the most likely evolutionary scenario given the data. However, ML analyses can be computationally intensive and sensitive to model assumptions, potentially leading to overfitting or inaccurate results if the chosen model does not accurately represent the evolutionary process.

  - Neighbor-Joining (NJ) methods are computationally efficient and less sensitive to model assumptions, making them suitable for large datasets. However, NJ trees may not always accurately capture complex evolutionary relationships.

  - Bayesian Inference (BN) methods offer a balance between ML and NJ approaches, incorporating probabilistic models to estimate phylogenetic trees. BN analyses allow for the integration of prior knowledge and uncertainty into the inference process, providing a more nuanced understanding of evolutionary relationships. However, BN methods can also be computationally demanding and sensitive to the choice of prior distributions.

## Conservation Implications

from the information i gathered from this [article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4290416/) there are multiple ways insights from phylogenetic trees used for conservation strategies. In recent years, there's been a growing recognition of how evolutionary biology can aid conservation efforts. Vane-Wright et al. proposed a method based on cladistic information to prioritize species for conservation, acknowledging that not all species have the same importance. Following this, Faith introduced the concept of phylogenetic diversity (PD), which measures biodiversity by considering the evolutionary history of species. PD has become a key metric in biodiversity assessment, but there's still room for improvement in how it's integrated into conservation planning to support long-term sustainability.
